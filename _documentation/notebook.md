    - [ ] auto reload
        - q: Hello I am new at blender addon scripting, using python 3.12 and blender version 4.2.0. I am trying to build an efficient development environment. I am using external text editor, and it takes too much time to click resolve conflicts on blender and run the script again.

        Trying to create an auto-script reloader that checks every second the changes on the main script file. Check is successful, run working without a problem but, I have problem with updating the code in blender text editor. I am seeking for any guidance on how to solve it. Thanks in advance
